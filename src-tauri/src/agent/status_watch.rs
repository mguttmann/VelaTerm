//! Process-wide view of which sessions are working, asking, or waiting, plus a way to block until that
//! changes.
//!
//! The authoritative state machine already knows all of this: agent hooks post to the local service and
//! it maps them to [`AgentState`]. What was missing is a way for something *outside* the frontend to ask,
//! and to wait. `vstat` is that consumer, and an orchestration's coordinator session lives on the waiting
//! form: it blocks here instead of polling, so watching several child sessions costs nothing between
//! events.
//!
//! **The version counter is the point.** Without it a waiter that was busy handling one change would miss
//! the next one and then block until its timeout, reporting nothing while work had actually finished. A
//! caller passes back the version it last saw; if the world moved on meanwhile, it returns immediately.
//! This is the same idea as an incremental read cursor.
//!
//! One `StatusWatch` per process, like the hook server it is fed by.
