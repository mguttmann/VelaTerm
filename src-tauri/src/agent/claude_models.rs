//! The model catalogue offered to a Claude chat session.
//!
//! Claude Code has no command that prints its models, so the versioned entries below are a curated
//! table rather than something the CLI reports. Two details make that table more than a list of
//! aliases. First, a `[1m]` suffix is a model identifier in its own right when a family offers both
//! standard and expanded contexts: passing `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` asks for the 1M-token window, so it
//! stays separate from `claude-opus-4-6`. A model that is natively 1M, such as Opus 5, has only one
//! selectable entry; retired suffixed spellings resolve to it. Second, newer models are rejected by
//! older CLIs, so entries carry the version that introduced them and are filtered accordingly.
//!
//! Custom identifiers the user configured under `env` in `settings.json` are appended afterwards. That
//! covers the case the curated table structurally cannot: a gateway identifier pointing at something
//! other than Anthropic's own models.
//!
//! Explicit 1M-context variants stay beside their standard model, matching Paseo's catalogue. Asking for
//! that expanded window can cost usage credits the account does not have, and the refusal is easy to miss:
//! the CLI answers the turn with an ordinary assistant message carrying `API Error: Usage credits required
//! for 1M context`, so nothing is actually run. Native 1M models do not carry the suffix and do not get a
//! second menu row.
//!
//! Everything here reads files and spawns `claude --version`, so callers must stay off the main
//! thread; dispatch already runs this inside a blocking worker.
